#Book Recommendation System using KNN Algorithm

This project aims to build a book recommendation system using the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The system takes in user input about their book preferences and recommends books similar to their interests based on the KNN algorithm. Additionally, the project also analyzes the dataset and visualizes key KPIs using barplots.

##Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Goodreads books dataset, which contains information about over 10,000 books, including title, author, rating, and genre.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
How to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the required packages.
Run python main.py to start the book recommendation system.
Follow the prompts to input your book preferences and receive recommendations.
KPI Visualizations
This project includes barplot visualizations of the following key performance indicators (KPIs):

Number of books by genre
Average rating by genre
Number of books by author
These visualizations can be found in the visualizations folder.

Future Work
Implement other recommendation algorithms (e.g., collaborative filtering)
Increase the size of the dataset for more accurate recommendations
Improve the user interface for easier input and visualization of recommendations
